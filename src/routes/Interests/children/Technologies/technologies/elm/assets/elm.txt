Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling. Elm was initially designed by Evan Czaplicki as his thesis in 2012. The first release of Elm came with many examples and an online editor that made it easy to try out in a web browser. Evan Czaplicki joined Prezi in 2013 to work on Elm, and in 2016 moved to NoRedInk as an Open Source Engineer, also starting the Elm Software Foundation.
I like Elm, because it is functional, and because it has similar syntax as Elixir's. Also the ideas that you have no runtime errors and no unknown broken packages are great, and it is what almost every front-end developer wants.
