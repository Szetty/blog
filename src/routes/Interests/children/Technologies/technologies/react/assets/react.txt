React allows developers to create large web applications that use data which can change over time, without reloading the page. Its main goal is to be fast, simple and scalable. React processes only user interface in applications. This corresponds to View in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) template, and can be used in combination with other JavaScript libraries or frameworks in MVC, such as AngularJS. It can also be used with React based on add-ons to take care of without the user interface parts of web developing.
I like ReactJS, because it inherits some ideas from functional programming. Also it is easy to integrate different React components into each other, making it one of the best tools to build a working user interface.
